**Amazon EventBridge** is a fully managed event bus service by AWS that allows you to connect applications by routing events from sources (such as GuardDuty) to target services (such as Lambda, SNS).  
**EventBridge** acts as the **security alert event catcher** from GuardDuty and **triggers Lambda** for automated processing.
