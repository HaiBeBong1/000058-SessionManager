	"content": "Building a Multi-Layered Automated Security Alert System on AWS In a cloud computing environment, timely detection and response to security threats is critical to protecting your systems.\nThis workshop will guide you through building a multi-layered security monitoring and alerting solution on AWS, integrating multiple services to automatically detect, isolate, and notify when an incident occurs.\nThis solution will use:\nAmazon GuardDuty to detect unusual behavior and potential threats. Amazon EventBridge to process and route security events. AWS Lambda to automate response actions (such as isolating and stopping compromised EC2 instances). Amazon SNS to send alerts to the operations team. Amazon S3 and DynamoDB to store incident information and related logs.

Click Start Session. Then select Public Linux Instance and click Start session to access the instance. Terminal will appear on the browser. Testing with the command sudo tcpdump -nn port 22 and sudo tcpdump we will see no SSH traffic but only HTTPS traffic. Above, we have created a connection to the public instance without opening SSH port 22, for better security, avoiding any attack to the SSH port.\nOne disadvantage of the above method is that we have to open the Security Group outbound at port 443 to the internet. Since it\u0026rsquo;s a public instance, it probably won\u0026rsquo;t be a problem, but if you want extra security, you can block port 443 to the internet and still use the Session Manager. We will go through this in the private instance section below.\nYou can click terminate to end the currently connected session before proceeding to the next step.\n"

Upon detection, it will send near real-time alerts and automatically respond to block the attacking IP using GuardDuty â†’ EventBridge â†’ Lambda.\nThe entire pipeline uses serverless services, including:\nAmazon GuardDuty: Threat detection Amazon EventBridge: Event listening and triggering AWS Lambda: Response logic processing Amazon SNS / DynamoDB: Multi-layer alerting System Architecture GuardDuty: Detects threats EventBridge: Captures threat events Lambda: Analyzes \u0026amp; responds SNS: Sends email alerts DynamoDB: Stores incident logs Workflow GuardDuty continuously monitors AWS resources and generates alerts (Findings) when unusual behavior is detected. EventBridge captures the GuardDuty Finding event and triggers the corresponding Lambda function. Lambda performs actions such as: Analyzing the alert content Extracting the attacking IP address Calling APIs to block the IP by modifying NACL or Security Group Logging the incident to DynamoDB Sending notifications via SNS (email) Workshop Content Enable GuardDuty and check sample alerts Create an EventBridge Rule to capture alerts from GuardDuty Write a Lambda function to process alerts and block IPs Send alerts to SNS and DynamoDB Test the system with simulated attack behavior (nmap) Summary \u0026amp; enhancements: automatically unblock IPs, set TTL, enforce stricter IAM permissions "

	"content": "2. Initial Preparation Steps Before starting to build the automated security detection and response system, you need to have the necessary AWS account prerequisites in place, as well as perform certain environment, resource, and access configurations to ensure the deployment process runs smoothly and accurately.\n2.1. Account and Access Requirements To deploy this system, you will need an AWS account that meets the following conditions:\nAWS account with billing enabled (can be a personal account, AWS Educate account, or Free Tier account). Access rights with AdministratorAccess or at least the minimum required permissions for: EC2, S3, Lambda, SNS, DynamoDB, EventBridge, IAM, GuardDuty. Recommended: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the root account or IAM user to enhance security. 2.2. AWS Free Tier Scope This workshop is designed to operate entirely within the AWS Free Tier limits, so there will be no costs incurred if you stay within the free usage limits.\nTable: Resource Usage Compared to Free Tier Limits\nService AWS Free Tier Limit Workshop Usage Amazon S3 5GB storage, 20,000 GET requests/month \u0026lt; 1GB, \u0026lt; 100 requests AWS Lambda 1 million requests/month, 400,000 GB-seconds \u0026lt; 1,000 requests Amazon SNS 1,000 email notifications/month \u0026lt; 50 notifications Amazon DynamoDB 25GB storage, 25 RCU/WCU \u0026lt; 1GB, only a few write operations Amazon GuardDuty Free for the first 30 days (first-time activation) Within free trial period Amazon EventBridge 100,000 events/month free \u0026lt; 1,000 events 2.3. Prepare the Practice Environment Before configuring the services, you should prepare a minimal practice environment as follows:\nRegion:\nIt is recommended to use us-east-1 or the region closest to you to reduce latency and increase compatibility with services.\nResource Naming Convention:\nTo make management easier, follow a consistent naming rule. For example:\nEC2 Instance: CompromisedEC2, MaliciousEC2 S3 Bucket: threat-list-[your-unique-id] IAM Role: LambdaSecurityRole Lambda Function: IsolateInstance EventBridge Rule: GuardDutyToLambdaRule SNS Topic: GuardDutyNotifications Valid Email Address:\nTo receive notifications from Amazon SNS, you must have an email address that can receive messages and confirm subscriptions.\nCheck IAM Permissions:\nEnsure the user/role you are using has permissions to create and modify the above-mentioned services. If using an IAM user, verify the attached policies.\nðŸ“Œ Note: Avoid using the root account for deployment â€” instead, use an IAM user with appropriate permissions.\n"
